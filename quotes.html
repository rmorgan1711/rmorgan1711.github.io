    <blockquote> …His most notable quality was, by his own account and in the view of all observers, a constant
        restlessness of mind. It was a quality that did his political career no good. One of the most important
        qualities in a politician… is the ability to suffer fools gracefully. Tocqueville lacked that ability to an
        almost pathological degree. He was not a snob, but he had a very acute sense of what it was about the manners
        and social style of the aristocracy that set them apart form the commercial middle class. Fawning, pandering,
        even passing the time of day with people he regarded as culturally, intellectually, and politically null was
        beyond him. He wanted to get on with the next matter that preoccupied his restless intelligence, and they knew
        it and resented it.

    <blockquote> They all talked at once, their voices insistent and contradictory and impatient, making of unreality a

    <blockquote> I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all
        specialists, the "well-rounded" man. This isn't just an epigram - life is much more successfully looked at from
        a single window, after all.

    <blockquote> Through multiplication upon multiplication of facts, information, theories, and hypotheses, it is
        science itself that is leading mankind from single absolute truths to multiple, indeterminate, relative ones.
        The major producer of the social chaos, the indeterminacy of thought and values that rational knowledge is
        supposed to eliminate, is none other than science itself.

    <blockquote> This you may say of man - when theories change and crash, when schools, philosophies, when narrow dark
        alleys of thought, national, religious, economic, grow and disintegrate, man reaches, stumbles forward,
        painfully, mistakenly sometimes. Having stepped forward, he may slip back, but only half a step, never the full
        step back. This you may say and know it and know it…. And this you can know - fear the time when Manself will
        not suffer and die for a concept, for this one quality is the foundation of Manself, and this one quality is
        man, distinctive in the universe.

    <blockquote> I think the difference between a lie and a story is that a story utilizes the trappings and appearance
        of truth for the interest of the listener as well as of the teller. A story has in it neither gain nor loss. But
        a lie is a device for profit or escape. I suppose if that definition is strictly held to, then a writer of
        stories is a liar - if he is financially fortunate.

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            Our species is the only creative species, and it has only one creative instrument, the individual mind
            and spirit of a man. Nothing was ever created by two men. There are no good collaborations, whether in
            music, in
            art, in poetry, in mathematics, in philosophy. Once the miracle of creation has taken place, the group can
            build
            and extend it, but the group never invents anything. The preciousness lies in the lonely mind of a man.

        </p>
        <p>
            And now the forces marshaled around the concept of the group have declared a war of extermination on that
            preciousness,
            the mind of a man. By disparagement, by starvation, by repressions, forced direction, and the stunning
            hammerblows of conditioning, the free, roving mind is being pursued, roped, blunted, drugged. It is a sad
            suicidal course our species seems to have taken.
        </p>
        <p>
            And this I believe: that the free, exploring mind of the
            individual human is the most valuable thing in the world. And this I would fight for: the freedom of the
            mind to
            take any direction it wishes, undirected. And this I must fight against: any idea, religion, or government
            which
            limits or destroys the individual. This is what I am and what I am about. I can understand why a system
            built on
            a pattern must try to destroy the free mind, for that is the one thing which can by inspection destroy such
            a
            system. Surely I can understand this, and I hate it and I will fight against it to preserve the one thing
            that
            separates us from the uncreative beasts. If the glory can be killed, we are lost.

    <blockquote> … People are interested only in themselves. If a story is not about the hearer he will not listen. And
        I here make a rule - a great and lasting story is about everyone or it will not last. The strange and foreign is
        not interesting - only the deeply personal and familiar.

    </blockquote>

    <blockquote> When a man comes to die, no matter what his talents and influence and genius, if he dies unloved his
        life must be a failure to him and his dying a cold horror. It seems to me that if you or I must choose between
        two courses of thought or action, we should remember our dying and try so to live that our death brings no
        pleasure to the world.
        <footer>- John Steinbeck (East of Eden p. 413)</footer>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote> We have only one story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the never-ending contest in ourselves of
        good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal.
        Vice has always a new fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is.

    <blockquote> When we our betters see bearing our woes,<br />

        Who alone suffers suffers most i' th' mind,<br />

        But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip<br />
        When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.

    <blockquote> The best thing for being sad is to learn something. That is the only thing that never fails. You may
        grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins,
        you may miss your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honour
        trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then - to learn. Learn why the world wags
        and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by,
        never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting. Learning is the thing for you. Look at what a lot of
        things there are to learn - pure science, the only purity there is. You can learn astronomy in a lifetime,
        natural history in three, literature in six. And then, after you have exhausted a milliard lifetimes in biology
        and medicine and theocriticism and geography and history and economics - why, you can start to make a cartwheel
        of the appropriate wood, or spend fifty years learning to begin to learn to beat your adversary at fencing.
        After that you can start again on mathematics, until it is time to learn to plough.

    <blockquote> If you want to live honestly, you will, by necessity, be confused on occasion. You have to make

    <blockquote> George's son [a dog] had done his work so thoroughly that he was considered too good a workman to live,
        and was, in fact, taken and tragically shot at twelve o'clock that same day - another instance of the untoward
        fate which so often attends dogs and other philosophers who follow out a train of reasoning to its logical
        conclusion and attempt perfectly consistent conduct in a world made up so largely of compromise.
        <footer>- Hardy (Far from the Madding Crowd p. 33 bottom)</footer>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote> That stillness, which struck casual observers more than anything else in his character and habit and
        seemed so precisely like the rest of inanition, may have been the perfect balance of enormous antagonistic
        forces - positives and negatives in fine adjustment. His equilibrium disturbed, he was in extremity at once. If
        an emotion possessed him at all, it ruled him; a feeling not mastering him was entirely latent. Stagnant or
        rapid, it was never slow. He was always hit mortally, or he was missed.
        <footer>- Hardy (Far from the Madding Crowd p. 95 bottom)</footer>

    <blockquote> When power leads man towards arrogance, poetry reminds him of his limitations. When power narrows the
        areas of man’s concern, poetry reminds him of the richness and diversity of his existence. When power corrupts,
        poetry cleanses. For art establishes the basic human truth which must serve as the touchstone of our judgment.

    <blockquote> Remember that you are an actor in a play, which is as the playwright wants it to be: short if he wants
        it short, long if he wants it long. If he wants you to play a beggar, play even this part skillfully, or a
        cripple, or a public official, or a private citizen. What is yours is to play the assigned part well. But to
        choose it belongs to someone else.

    </blockquote>

    <blockquote> No one but you knows whether you are base and cruel, or loyal and dedicated. Others never see you: they
        surmise about you from uncertain conjectures; they do not see your nature so much as your artifice. So do not
        cling to their sentence: cling to your own.

    <blockquote> …I have seen one man of the same rank as he was to whom that conclusion would, I believe, even more
        properly apply: never in a middle position, always flying to one extreme or the other for causes impossible to
        divine; no kind of progress without astonishing side-tracking and back-tracking; none of his aptitudes
        straightforward, such that the most true-to-life portrait you will be able to sketch of him one day will show
        that he strove and studied to make himself known as unknowable.

    <blockquote> When I dance, I dance. When I sleep, I sleep; and when I am strolling alone through a beautiful

    <blockquote> Brandon is just the kind of man… whom every body speaks well of, and nobody cares about; whom all are

    <blockquote> As for ourselves, vulgar men, to whom Heaven has not vouchsafed such great talents and whom it does not
        destine for so much glory, let us remain in our obscurity. Let us not run after a reputation which would escape
        us, and which, in the present state of things, would never return to us what it would have cost us, even if we
        had every title to obtain it.

    <blockquote> Don’t make the mistake of believing that because you weren’t punished immediately for a sin that there
        is no God or that sin goes unpunished. If you steal or lie or blaspheme against Him, God isn’t going to hit you
        with a lightning bolt or turn you into a pillar of salt. He will give you space and time to repent. In some
        cases, that will be years. But ultimately, if you don’t repent, you will be punished. When you see miserably
        unhappy adults who punish themselves with alcohol and unhappy relationships and who are filled with so much fear
        and hatred that it makes you afraid to think of being with them or being like them, they didn’t get that way
        over night. Somewhere, long ago, when they were your age, they intentionally did something wrong and decided,
        because they weren’t hit with a lightning bolt, that they had ‘gotten away with it.’ Look at them. Do you think
        they ‘got away with it’? And that’s only in this world. Imagine what they’re going to experience in the next
        world. Do the things that are right and don’t do the things that are wrong. You know the difference.

        by better information or fuller consideration to change opinions even on important subjects, which I once
        thought right, but found to be otherwise. It is therefore that the older I grow, the more apt I am to doubt my

        <p>
            America is the wealthiest nation on Earth, but its people are mainly poor, and poor Americans are urged
            to hate themselves. To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, “It ain’t no disgrace to be poor, but it
            might
            as well be.” It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor.
            Every
            other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more
            estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves
            and
            glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is
            very
            likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: “If you’re so smart, why ain’t you rich?”
            There
            will also be an American flag no larger than a child’s hand - glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the
            cash

            Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most
            destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in
            fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves.
            This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor,

            accelerate. Never pull over with the first siren-howl. Mash it down and make the bastard chase you at speeds
            up
            to 120 all the way to the next exit. He will follow. But he won’t know what to make of you blinker-signal

            keep signaling and hope for an off-ramp, one of those uphill side-loops with a sign saying “Max Speed 25”…
            and
            the trick, at this point, is to suddenly leave the freeway and take him into the chute at no less than a

            the Gs
            and the fast heal-toe work, and with any luck at all you will have come to a complete stop off the road at
            the
            top of the turn and be standing beside your automobile by the time he catches up.

            He will not be reasonable at

            a
            turmoil: he may begin jabbering, or even pull his gun. Let him unwind; keep smiling. The idea is to show him
            that you were always in total control of yourself and your vehicle - while he lost control of everything.
